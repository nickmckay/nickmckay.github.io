      <title>Bridging Ancient Lakes and Climate Models: A Revolutionary Approach to Understanding 21,000 Years of Water History</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most rewarding aspects of being a professor is watching your students push the boundaries of what&amp;rsquo;s possible in science. Today, I want to tell you about a study that makes me incredibly proud—not just because of the groundbreaking science, but because it represents everything I love about mentoring the next generation of climate scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My former PhD student Chris Hancock has just published something that&amp;rsquo;s never been done before: the world&amp;rsquo;s first global data assimilation of hydroclimate patterns spanning the last 21,000 years, using a clever approach centered on lake level records.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Mountains Lose Their White Caps: Arctic Glaciers Reveal 150 Meters of Climate Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On mountain glaciers, in the summer, the snow accumulated all summer begins to melt, starting at lower elevations and working its way up. By the end of summer the line is as high as it will get that year. This line, called the snowline, represents the elevation where winter snowfall balances summer melting. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple concept, but it turns out to be good indicator of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our latest study published in &lt;em&gt;The Cryosphere&lt;/em&gt;, my colleague Laura Larocca led a study where we documented something remarkable and concerning: across the Arctic, glacier snowlines have risen an average of 150 meters over the past four decades. To put that in perspective, that&amp;rsquo;s like moving the snow boundary from the base of the Statue of Liberty to the top of her torch—every single decade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rethinking Ancient Climate: The 4.2 ka Event Wasn&#39;t So Global After All</title>
      <link>https://nickmckay.github.io/blog/4.2ka-event-not-remarkable/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the geological community made a significant decision: they designated a period of severe drought around 4,200 years ago, known as the &amp;ldquo;4.2 ka event&amp;rdquo; as the marker for a new subdivision of our current geological epoch, the Holocene. This drought (or sometimes other climate phenomena in some studies) was thought to be so globally catastrophic that it marked a significant interval in our climate story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what did something that remarkable actually happen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tracing Water&#39;s Global Journey: How Temperature Has Always Driven Earth&#39;s Water Cycle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nickmckay.github.io/img/water-cycle-featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Water cycle research&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water is life. It&amp;rsquo;s also one of the most complex and important systems on our planet. So when we ask what happens to water availability as global temperatures continue to rise, we&amp;rsquo;re really asking one of the most critical questions of our time—one with multi-billion dollar implications for societies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To find answers about the future, my colleagues and I did what paleoclimatologists do best: we looked to the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
