## Overview

At the forefront of modern paleoclimatology is the concept of integrating mechanistic modeling with reconstruction and synthesis techniques. The goal is to incorporate scientific understanding of the environmental processes that control how climate variability is recorded by the natural archives we use to understand past changes.

## Arctic Lake Systems

For lake systems, this research avenue is largely unexplored. We're collaborating with the University of Alaska Fairbanks are working to develop systems models that simulate how climate variability is filtered through glacier-river-lake systems at three glacier-fed lake basins in the Arctic.

## Field Observations

As part of this project, we've setup a major new field-based observational network at **Lake Peters** in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge in the Brooks Range, in the northeast corner of Alaska. This network provides crucial validation data for our process models.

## Research Approach

Our approach combines:

1. **Field Monitoring**: Real-time observations of glacier-river-lake systems
2. **Process Models**: Mechanistic models of sediment transport and deposition
3. **Paleoclimate Records**: Long-term records from lake sediments
4. **Data Integration**: Combining observations, models, and reconstructions

## Study Sites

- **Lake Peters** (Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska)
- **Additional Arctic lake basins** (in development)

## Funding

This research is funded by the **National Science Foundation's Arctic System Science program**.
