## Overview

We use lake sediments to develop new records of past climate. Recently, we have been developing new study areas in southern Colorado. Winter snowpack in the San Juan Mountains feed the Colorado and Rio Grande rivers, and is particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and earlier melt seasons. 

## Dust-Drought Interactions

Snowpack in the region is also vulnerable to dust accumulation on snow, which catalyzes earlier snowmelt. In this way dust and drought interact, however we have very few observations of this interaction under natural conditions, which limits our capacity to evaluate how well climate models simulate this feedback.

We're developing new records from the abundant lakes and moisture-sensitive tree-ring records in southern Colorado to reconstruct how dust and drought interact over the past several thousand years. Using that new understanding we're collaborating with Toby Ault at Cornell University to investigate how and why climate models simulate that interaction.

## Current Projects

- **Phase II Dust-Drought Research**: Foundation-funded project using low-cost sensors on uncrewed aircraft and weather balloons
- **San Juan Mountains Lake Network**: Developing climate records from multiple high-elevation lakes
- **Tree-Ring Integration**: Combining lake sediment records with dendrochronology

## Funding

This research is supported by the **Bob and Judi Braudy Foundation**.
