## Overview

An overarching goal of our research is to understand large-scale changes in past climate dynamics. There are two basic approaches to addressing these questions, and we pursue both actively.

## Regional Synthesis

The first approach involves synthesizing paleoclimate evidence for broad regions and estimating past climate changes in both space and time. We're deeply involved in this approach, developing reconstructions for the past 2,000 years in both the Arctic and more recently in continental-scale regions throughout the world through the international **Past Global Changes program**.

### Key Synthesis Projects

- **Arctic 2k** - Temperature reconstructions for the Arctic over the past 2,000 years
- **Continental-scale reconstructions** - Regional climate synthesis across multiple continents
- **Multi-proxy integration** - Combining different types of paleoclimate records

## Data-Model Integration

A critical, complementary approach to understanding past climate dynamics is to perform and investigate paleoclimate model simulations with state-of-the-art climate models. Our research focuses on **data-model intercomparison**, where we aim to get at the best of both worlds by combining:

- **Global coverage** and detailed climate physics of climate models
- **Details of what actually happened** from the paleoclimate record

### Methods

- **Climate model evaluation** using paleoclimate data
- **Data assimilation** techniques for paleoclimate reconstruction
- **Ensemble approaches** for uncertainty quantification
- **Process-level validation** of climate model components

## International Collaborations

### Past Global Changes (PAGES)

We are active contributors to the international PAGES program, participating in:

- **2k Network** - Global temperature reconstructions for the past 2,000 years
- **Regional working groups** - Arctic, North America, and other regional syntheses
- **Methods development** - Improving synthesis and reconstruction techniques

### Key Publications

Our synthesis work has contributed to major international assessments and high-profile scientific publications that inform our understanding of natural climate variability and model evaluation.

## Impact

This research directly informs:

- **Climate model development** and validation
- **Understanding of natural climate variability**
- **Climate sensitivity estimates**
- **Regional climate projections**
