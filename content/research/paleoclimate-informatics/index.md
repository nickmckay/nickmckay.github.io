## The Problem

Our work in paleoclimate synthesis projects has revealed the dire state of paleoclimatic data structure and access. The lack of uniform data formats or standards in the community means that paleoclimate dynamicists spend most of their time on data discovery, retrieval, and formatting, rather than on investigating the scientific questions of interest.

Moreover, this extensive effort is being needlessly repeated by various research groups around the world. Critical complementary data and metadata are typically excluded as they further complicate this data organization process.

## Our Solution

In an effort to improve on this situation, we have developed a research focus in **paleoclimate informatics**. Over the past couple of years this research theme has matured considerably, along with collaborators at the University of Southern California.

## Major Projects

### LiPD (Linked Paleo Data)

We led the development of the **first ever data format for paleoclimatology**. LiPD provides:

- **Standardized data structure** for paleoclimate datasets
- **Rich metadata** support for comprehensive data description
- **Software tools** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Interoperability** with existing paleoclimate databases

### Linked Earth Platform

We're developing the **Linked Earth wiki**, which includes:

- **Community-driven vocabularies** for paleoclimate terminology
- **Semantic wiki technology** for collaborative development
- **Ontology development** for paleoclimate concepts
- **Crowd-sourced standardization** of data descriptions

## Research Focus Areas

### Data Interoperability

- Developing utilities to seamlessly integrate paleoclimate datasets
- Creating tools for data format conversion and standardization
- Building APIs for programmatic data access

### Uncertainty Quantification

- Developing methods to quantify and visualize the effects of geochronologic uncertainty
- Creating tools for uncertainty propagation in paleoclimate analyses
- Improving statistical methods for age model development

### Semantic Technologies

- Building ontologies for paleoclimate science
- Developing semantic web technologies for data discovery
- Creating linked data approaches for paleoclimate datasets

## Tools and Software

### Open Source Contributions

All our informatics tools are open source and available on GitHub:

- **LiPD utilities** (R, Python, MATLAB)
- **GeoChronR** - Age-model and uncertainty tools
- **Linked Earth platform** - Web-based data standardization
- **Various analysis packages** for paleoclimate data

## Community Impact

Our informatics work has:

- **Standardized data sharing** in paleoclimate science
- **Reduced time spent** on data formatting and discovery
- **Improved reproducibility** of paleoclimate research
- **Enhanced data preservation** and long-term accessibility
