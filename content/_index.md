description: I use natural records of past climate variability to inform our understanding 
  of climate dynamics. My research spans from the tropics to the Arctic, on timescales 
  ranging years to millennia and on spatial scales ranging from hemispheres to meters. 
  Through my work directing the Paleoclimate Dynamics Laboratory at Northern Arizona 
  University, I help prepare for and adapt to future climate changes by better understanding 
  the complex details of our climate and earth systems.
