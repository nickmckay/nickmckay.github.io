## Current Opportunities

### PhD Position: Paleoclimate Data Assimilation for North American Ecosystem Research

**Funding:** NSF-funded project  
**Duration:** 4 years  
**Start Date:** Spring or Fall 2026

#### Project Overview

We are seeking a motivated PhD student to join an exciting new NSF-funded project led by Jack Williams at the University of Wisconsin, with NAU as a partner institution. This interdisciplinary project aims to understand how ecosystems respond to climate change by studying past climate-ecosystem relationships from the Last Glacial Maximum to present.

#### Your Role at NAU

Working with Dr. McKay and collaborator Dr. Michael Erb (Appalachian State University), you will lead the development of cutting-edge paleoclimate reconstructions for North America using **paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA)**. This innovative approach combines:

- **Proxy records** (lake sediments, speleothems, ice cores, etc.) with
- **Physics-based climate models** to create spatially complete reconstructions
- **Statistical downscaling** techniques for ecological applications

#### What is Paleoclimate Data Assimilation?

PDA uses a Kalman filter approach to optimally combine proxy observations with climate model simulations. The method:

- Starts with an ensemble of climate model states
- Compares model output with proxy data using statistical relationships
- Updates reconstructions to better match observations
- Spreads information across space and time using model covariance patterns

This approach overcomes limitations of proxy-only or model-only reconstructions.

#### Research Opportunities

- Develop custom paleoclimate reconstructions for ecological research
- Work with state-of-the-art data assimilation techniques
- Collaborate with leading researchers across multiple institutions
- Contribute to climate change policy and conservation science
- Publish in high-impact journals

#### Ideal Candidate

- Strong background in Earth sciences, climate science, or related field
- Interest in quantitative methods and statistical analysis
- Experience with programming (R, Python)
- Enthusiasm for interdisciplinary collaboration
- Excellent communication skills

#### How to Apply

Contact Dr. McKay directly with your CV, research interests, and a brief statement of why this project appeals to you. Early inquiries are encouraged as the position will be filled for  either Spring or Fall 2026.
