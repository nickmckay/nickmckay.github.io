In 2018, the geological community made a significant decision: they designated the 4.2 ka event—a period of severe drought around 4,200 years ago—as the marker for a new subdivision of our current geological epoch, the Holocene. This drought was thought to be so globally catastrophic that it fundamentally changed our planet's climate story.

But what if we got it wrong?

## When Students Become Co-Discoverers

This story actually begins in my graduate-level paleoclimatology class at Northern Arizona University. Rather than just teaching about climate analysis methods, I decided to put my students to work on a real research question: Just how remarkable was the 4.2 ka event in the context of the entire Holocene?

What started as a class exercise turned into something much bigger—a rigorous analysis that would challenge one of geology's most recent decisions and ultimately land us in *Nature Communications*.

## The Power of Big Data Meets Ancient Climate

Here's what we did that was different: instead of looking at a handful of carefully selected climate records, we cast our net wide. Really wide. We analyzed over 1,000 paleoclimate datasets spanning the last 12,000 years—essentially the entire Holocene period.

But analyzing that much data requires sophisticated tools. We developed an enhanced method to objectively detect climate events in paleoclimate data, removing human bias from the equation. No more cherry-picking dramatic examples or assuming what we expected to find.

## The Surprising Results

What we discovered was eye-opening: the 4.2 ka event simply wasn't as globally remarkable as we thought.

Yes, there was a significant drought in some regions around 4,200 years ago. But when we looked at the bigger picture—across space and time—this event didn't stand out as uniquely catastrophic. Climate changes during this period were more localized and varied than previously believed.

Think of it this way: if you only looked at temperature records from Phoenix in July, you might conclude that Earth is a blazingly hot planet. But zoom out to include the whole globe and all seasons, and you get a very different picture.

## What This Means for How We Understand Climate

This isn't just an academic exercise in historical nitpicking. Understanding how climate has changed naturally in the past is crucial for understanding what might happen in the future.

Natural changes in climate can occur on century timescales, but these are fundamentally different from the massive changes we're seeing now due to human CO2 emissions. By getting a clearer picture of natural climate variability, we can better distinguish between what's natural and what's human-caused.

Our research also highlights an important lesson: local dramatic climate changes don't necessarily indicate global trends. This is something we see today too—extreme weather in one region doesn't always reflect global patterns.

## The Collaborative Spirit of Science

One of the things I'm most proud of about this project is how it came together. The co-authors on this paper included not just faculty, but also current students and alumni from my lab. This research represents the kind of collaborative, hands-on learning that produces both great scientists and great science.

We've also made our analysis methods freely available for other researchers to use, because science works best when we build on each other's work.

## Looking Forward

Does this mean the 4.2 ka subdivision of the Holocene was a mistake? That's for the geological community to decide. But our research does suggest we should be cautious about using single dramatic climate events as global markers without thoroughly examining their global significance.

What I know for certain is that this project demonstrates the power of combining big data approaches with rigorous statistical methods. As we continue to build larger databases of paleoclimate information, we'll undoubtedly discover more surprises about how our climate system has behaved in the past.

And those discoveries will help us better prepare for an uncertain climate future.
