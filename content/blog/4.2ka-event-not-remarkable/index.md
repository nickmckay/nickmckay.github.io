In 2018, the geological community made a significant decision: they designated a period of severe drought around 4,200 years ago, known as the "4.2 ka event" as the marker for a new subdivision of our current geological epoch, the Holocene. This drought (or sometimes other climate phenomena in some studies) was thought to be so globally catastrophic that it marked a significant interval in our climate story.

But what did something that remarkable actually happen?

## When Students Become Co-Discoverers

This story (or at least this chapter of this story) actually begins in a graduate-level paleoclimatology seminar at Northern Arizona University. Rather than just reading and discussing paleoclimate papers, we decided to try something different, picking up this question that we'd be considering for years: Just how remarkable was the 4.2 ka event in the context of the entire Holocene?

What started as a class exercise turned into something much bigger—a rigorous analysis that would challenge one of geology's most recent decisions and ultimately land us in *Nature Communications*.

## The Power of Big Data Meets Ancient Climate

Here's what we did that was different: instead of looking at a handful of carefully selected climate records, we cast our net wide. Really wide. We analyzed over 1,000 paleoclimate datasets that spanned the breadth of the entire Holocene period.

But analyzing that much data requires sophisticated tools. We developed an enhanced method to objectively detect climate events in paleoclimate data, removing human bias from the equation. No more cherry-picking dramatic examples or assuming what we expected to find.

## The Surprising Results

What we discovered was eye-opening: the 4.2 ka event simply wasn't as globally remarkable as was widely reported in the literature.

Yes, there was a significant drought in some regions around 4,200 years ago. But when we looked at the bigger picture, across both space and time, this event didn't stand out as uniquely catastrophic. Climate changes during this period were more localized and varied than previously believed, and completely in line with what we saw during any other similar-length interval in the Holocene. 

Think of it this way: if you only looked at temperature records from Phoenix in July, you might conclude that Earth is a blazingly hot planet. But zoom out to include the whole globe and all seasons, and you get a very different picture.

## What This Means for How We Understand Climate

This isn't just an academic exercise in historical nitpicking. Understanding how climate has changed naturally in the past is crucial for understanding what might happen in the future.

Natural changes in climate can occur on century timescales, but these are fundamentally different from the massive changes we're seeing now due to human CO_2 emissions. By getting a clearer picture of natural climate variability, we can better distinguish between what's natural and what's human-caused.

Our research also highlights an important lesson: local dramatic climate changes don't necessarily indicate global trends. This is something we see today too—extreme weather in one region doesn't always reflect global patterns.

## The Collaborative Spirit of Science

One of the things I'm most proud of about this project is how it came together. The co-authors on this paper included not just faculty, but also current students and alumni from my lab. This research represents the kind of collaborative, hands-on learning that produces both great scientists and great science.

We've also made our analysis methods freely available for other researchers to use as part of the actR (abrupt change toolkit in R) package, because science works best when we build on each other's work.

## Looking Forward

Does this mean the 4.2 ka subdivision of the Holocene was a mistake? Yes, almost certainly. Our research suggests we should be cautious about using single dramatic climate events as global markers without thoroughly examining their global significance.

This project also demonstrates the power of combining big data approaches with rigorous statistical methods. As we continue to build larger databases of paleoclimate data, and better tools to analyze them, we'll undoubtedly discover more surprises about how our climate system has behaved in the past.

And those discoveries will help us better prepare for an uncertain climate future.
