PReSto (Paleoclimate Reconstruction Storehouse) is an interactive web platform I developed to make paleoclimate reconstructions accessible to researchers, educators, and students. The platform provides an intuitive interface for exploring how Earth's climate has changed from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present day.

## Key Features

**Interactive Exploration**
- Browse published paleoclimate reconstructions across different time periods
- Focus periods: Holocene (24-0 ka) and Common Era (2-0 ka)
- Interactive maps and visualizations of global climate patterns

**Educational Resources**
- Comprehensive explanations of paleoclimate concepts
- Guidance on interpreting different proxy types
- Resources for understanding uncertainty in paleoclimate data

**Scientific Applications**
- Access to published reconstruction datasets
- Tools for custom analysis and visualization
- Integration with modern paleoclimate data standards

## Paleoclimate Archives

PReSto showcases data from multiple paleoclimate archives:
- **Tree rings** - Annual growth records from living and fossil trees
- **Ice cores** - Atmospheric and precipitation records from polar regions
- **Sediment cores** - Marine and lacustrine environmental records
- **Corals** - High-resolution tropical ocean records

## Design Philosophy

The platform emphasizes:
- **Accessibility** - Making complex scientific data understandable
- **Interactivity** - Allowing users to explore data dynamically
- **Education** - Supporting learning about past climate variability
- **Research** - Facilitating scientific analysis and discovery

## Technical Implementation

- Responsive web design optimized for desktop viewing
- Built with modern web technologies
- User feedback integration via Google Forms
- Continuous updates with new paleoclimate reconstructions

## Impact & Usage

PReSto serves multiple communities:
- **Researchers** exploring paleoclimate patterns and processes
- **Educators** teaching about climate variability and change
- **Students** learning about Earth's climate history
- **Policy makers** understanding natural climate variability

## Future Development

The platform continues to evolve with:
- New reconstruction datasets
- Enhanced visualization capabilities
- Improved educational resources
- Extended time period coverage

PReSto represents my commitment to making paleoclimate science accessible and engaging for diverse audiences while supporting rigorous scientific research.
