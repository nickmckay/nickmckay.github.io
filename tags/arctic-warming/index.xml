      <title>When Mountains Lose Their White Caps: Arctic Glaciers Reveal 150 Meters of Climate Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On mountain glaciers, in the summer, the snow accumulated all summer begins to melt, starting at lower elevations and working its way up. By the end of summer the line is as high as it will get that year. This line, called the snowline, represents the elevation where winter snowfall balances summer melting. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple concept, but it turns out to be good indicator of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our latest study published in &lt;em&gt;The Cryosphere&lt;/em&gt;, my colleague Laura Larocca led a study where we documented something remarkable and concerning: across the Arctic, glacier snowlines have risen an average of 150 meters over the past four decades. To put that in perspective, that&amp;rsquo;s like moving the snow boundary from the base of the Statue of Liberty to the top of her torchâ€”every single decade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
